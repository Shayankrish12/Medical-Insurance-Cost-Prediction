🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on demographic and health factors. Using Python and linear regression, the model analyzes how attributes like age, BMI, smoking status, and region impact insurance charges.

🚀 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model training using Linear Regression

Performance evaluation with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes key attributes such as:

Age: Patient's age

Sex: Gender (Male/Female)

BMI: Body Mass Index

Children: Number of dependents

Smoker: Smoking status

Region: Residential area

Charges: Medical insurance cost (Target variable)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, train-test split, evaluation metrics)

📊 Results

The trained model provides insights into which factors significantly influence insurance costs. The impact of smoking, BMI, and age are key predictors of higher charges.
